This is an app to add and manage your daily tasks that you have to do

## objective

I created this project to help you manage your daily tasks, as state above but i also created it for educational purposes. No copyright infringement intended

I practiced a lot with this project but here are the few recognizable concepts:
1. React Basics (components, JSX, props)
2. Styling React components
3. Working with React hooks (useState, useRef, useContext)
4. Working with forms and user input in React
6. Version control with Git and Github
5. Deploying React apps
