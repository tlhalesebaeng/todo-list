# todo-list

This [todo-list](https://tlhalefo-todo-list.netlify.app/) app is a great app to add and manage daily tasks that you have to do.

## Objective

I created this project not only to help you manage your daily tasks but for educational purposes too. I will still use this project to learn a lot of other cool stuff.

I practiced a lot with this project but here are the few recognizable concepts:

1. React Basics (components, JSX, props, etc..)
2. Styling React components
3. Working with React hooks (useState, useRef and useContext)
4. Working with forms and user input in React
5. Version control with Git and Github
6. Testing react apps with vitest (jest) and react-testing-library
7. Deploying React apps
